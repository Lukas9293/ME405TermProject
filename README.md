# ME 405 Term Project
Welcome to our ME 405 Term Project! We are Lukas Moreau and Patrick Michael, and this repository documents our work on the Romi robot time-trial challenge. Our goal is to design, build, and program an autonomous Romi robot to navigate a track efficiently and reliably. 

This repository contains all the necessary code, wiring diagrams, and documentation for our project. Below, you'll find a structured breakdown of our work, including state machine design, sensor integration, and control strategies.
